# Carbon-Monoxide-Concentration-Control-Circuit
This project designs a CO concentration control system using resistive gas sensors to activate a ventilation fan when CO exceeds 12,000 ppm and turn it off below 800 ppm, with a hysteresis comparator controlling the fan via a relay circuit, and a red LED indicating its status.
